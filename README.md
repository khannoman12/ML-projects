# Diamond Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict diamond prices based on their characteristics (the 4Cs and other features).

## Overview

This project utilizes a dataset of diamond information (carat, cut, color, clarity, etc.) to train a regression model. The goal is to accurately estimate diamond prices, which can be useful for buyers, sellers, and investors.

## Files

*   `Diamond_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
*   `diamonds.csv`: The dataset used for training (if included in the repo. If you used a public dataset like the one from Kaggle, mention it here instead of including the file).
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   Pandas
*   Scikit-learn
*   Jupyter Notebook

## Model

The project uses [mention the main model used, e.g., Random Forest Regression]. Other models may have been explored in the notebook.

## Key Features (Optional - if space allows)

*   [Mention a key metric, e.g., Achieved an R-squared score of 0.95.]
*   [Mention a key insight, e.g., Carat weight is the most significant predictor of price.]

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Diamond_Price_Prediction.ipynb`
3.  Run the cells in the notebook.

## Dataset

[Mention where the dataset came from. If from Kaggle, say 'Dataset from Kaggle: [Kaggle Dataset URL]'. If it's your own, briefly describe it.]
